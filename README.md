## 📌 Java Pattern-Based Project

### 👩‍💻 Developer Details:

* **Name**: Khyati Sharma
* **Course**: Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)
* **Year/Semester**: 2nd Year, 3rd Semester
* **College**: Dezyne Ecole College, Ajmer



### 📁 Project Overview:

This project is a **pattern-based console application in Java**, created as a part of the academic coursework. It is built to help understand the structure and logic of pattern generation using Java fundamentals.



### 🔧 Project Features:

* ✅ Menu-driven interface for user-friendly navigation.
* ✅ Contains **10 different pattern options** for the user to select.
* ✅ Each pattern is displayed based on user choice.
* ✅ Uses **dynamic user input** for pattern display.
* ✅ All patterns are displayed neatly using loops and logical conditions.
* ✅ Easy to use and beginner-friendly structure.



### 💡 Concepts Used:

* ➤ **Java Basics** – Syntax, structure, and programming flow.
* ➤ **Control Statements** – Use of `if`, `switch`, and `break`.
* ➤ **Looping** – Extensive use of `for` and `while` loops for pattern generation.
* ➤ **User Input** – Utilizes `Scanner` class to get inputs from users at runtime.
* ➤ **Menu Design** – Simple menu to select from multiple pattern options.



### 📚 Purpose of the Project:

* 🔹 To understand the working of loops and conditionals in Java.
* 🔹 To develop logic building and pattern design skills.
* 🔹 To learn how to create interactive Java programs using user input.
* 🔹 To demonstrate the use of menu-driven programming structure.



### 📎 Notes:

* This project is developed for academic and learning purposes.
* It is ideal for students beginning with Java programming.
* The code is simple, clean, and easy to modify or extend.
